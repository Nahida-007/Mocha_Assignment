## Install dependencies by running

`npm install`

- Now you can write the tests to test the functions `countDocumentsByQuery` and `insertIntoDb` and push it to the same repository.
- Also you need to write tests which will let the developer know where the gaps are in terms of error handling.


## Note

If you're familiar only with Manual QA process then you can write the manual test cases for the given set of functions depending on your research and undertanding of MongoDB.
